Project Name: Simorgh Restaurant
TO DO:
When you open Simorgh Restaurant program you see a button which its name is "Menu".
When you click on "Menu" button you can see the restaurant menu and then you could choose "Pishgaza","Ghazayeaslii" and "Dessert" which are represent as appetizer, main course and dessert, respectively.
And when you choose your food you must click on "Set" button to set your order And then you can see your order and the price of it in the table of the right page.
If you want to change your order (for example: If you want to change your "Desert") you must choose it in the table then click on the "Update" button (under the table on the right side of the page),
then you can change your order and to set your new order you must click on the "Update" button (on the left side of the page) and then you can see your new order and the new price of it.
And if you want to delete your order you can click on the "Delete" button.
And at last I want to say that all orders of the restaurant save in MONGO DB COMPASS.
Hope you enjoy my program.
